RECIPES

FIND
User should be able to find recipes by
    - author - list all author's recipes
    - name - list all with the name
    - required ingredients - list of ingredients that have to be in recipe
    - optional ingredients - calculate score and sort by it?

Should all search options be available together?
    Yes, why not.

Choosing a recipe should open it with id as path param. Next time user might just open a link with id, so
    - find by ID is also required (simple GET)

CREATE/UPDATE
    - recipe name is not unique but required
    - author is added automatically (only signed up users are allowed to create recipe)
    - only author can update its own recipe (after signing in)
    - at least two (?) ingredients must be provided?
    - POST request

    - Cascade.ALL allows to create related entities with actual entity.
        It is in Recipe on Ingredients, but it is not in Ingredient on Recipes,
        meaning this way Recipe can be created with new Ingredient, but Ingredient must not be created with recipe.
        Recipe must not be created using detached Ingredient, when Ingredient with the same name already exists.
        Thus if Ingredient exists, it has to be pulled from DB or cache to save properly a Recipe.

DELETE
    - only author can delete its own recipe (after signing in)
    - recipe should not be deleted immediately (first only mark, delete with cron job? after a week?)

---------------
INGREDIENTS/ RECIPE_INGREDIENT

FIND
User should be able to find recipes by
    - name
For cache recipeingredients should be grouped by ingredient name and if count reaches some level, those ingredients
    should be added to cache

CREATE/UPDATE
    - Ingredients should be suggested. If for new recipe existing is used, do not create new ingredient - add new
        RecipeIngredient entry with existing ingredient name. In case of update, when instead of existing new one is
        used - create new ingredient.
        Scenarios:
            + User creating recipe types name of ingredient. While he is typing, suggested ingredients pop up. (Full text search?)
                If he chooses one then it is passed to new recipe.
                If he creates new one, it is created with the recipe?
            + For update it will be the same

DELETE
    - recipeingredients should be deleted along with recipes
    - ingredients should be deleted by a job if there is no recipeingredient for it
